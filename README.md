Input Variables: The model takes into account several features such as the car's make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, engine size, fuel type, transmission type, and more. Each of these factors is crucial in determining the overall value of a car.

Data Preprocessing: Before feeding the data into the model, preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features are applied. This ensures that the data is clean and ready for analysis.

Modeling Techniques: Various regression algorithms are explored, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). The best-performing model is selected based on accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and other relevant metrics.

Evaluation Metrics: The model is evaluated using cross-validation techniques to ensure its robustness and generalization capability. Metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to assess performance.

Feature Importance: The model also provides insights into the importance of each feature in predicting the car's price, helping users understand the most influential factors.
This car price prediction model can be used by car dealerships, buyers, and sellers to estimate the fair market value of a vehicle. It can also be integrated into online platforms that assist users in buying or selling cars by providing price recommendations.
